# Word Cloud - Python Example
A wordcloud is a visual representation of textual data. We use the property standard violations data from http://data.nashiville.gov. The data file contains tens of thoudsands of violation records over three year period. Even though the dataset contains structured data, one of the columns contains free-form text which describes the incident. We use Python Word Cloud library to generate a word cloud which helps depict the most frequent issues. As can be seen, grass is the most prominent one. A few frequent words including "tall", "high", "weed" appear to imply the characteristics of the issue - too tall, too high, or too many weed. We used a house-shape image as the background. Without the background image, the wordcloud would have the shape of a rectangle.
